; NOTE(casey): These ASM routines are written for the Windows
; 64-bit ABI. They expect RCX to be the first parameter (the count),
; and in the case of MOVAllBytesASM, RDX to be the second
; parameter (the data pointer). To use these on a platform
; with a different ABI, you would have to change those registers
; to match the ABI.
